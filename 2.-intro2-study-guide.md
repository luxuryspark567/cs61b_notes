### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

**Command line compilation and execution.** <mark style="color:red;">`javac`</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">is used to compile programs.</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">`java`</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">is used to execute programs.</mark> We must always compile before execution.

**Client Programs and Main Methods.** A Java program without a main method cannot be run directly using the `java` command. However, its methods can still be invoked using the `main` method of another class.

**Class Declaration.** Java classes can contain methods and/or variables. We say that such methods and variables are “members” of the class. Members can be _instance_ members or _static_ members. Static members are declared with the `static` keyword. Instance members are any members without the `static` keyword.

**Class Instantiation.** <mark style="color:red;">Instantiating a class is almost always done using the</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">`new`</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">keyword</mark>, e.g. `Dog d = new Dog()`. An instance of a class in Java is also called an “Object”.

**Dot Notation.** We access members of a class using dot notation, e.g. `d.bark()`. Class members can be accessed from within the same class or from other classes.

**Constructors.** <mark style="color:red;">Constructors tell Java what to do when a program tries to create an instance of a class</mark>, e.g. what it should do when it executes `Dog d = new Dog()`.

<mark style="color:red;">**Array Instantiation.**</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">Arrays are also instantiated using the</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">`new`</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">keyword. For example</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">`int[] arr = new int[10]`</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">If we have an array of Objects, e.g.</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">`Dog[] dogarray`</mark><mark style="color:red;">, then each element of the array must also be instantiated separately.</mark>

```java
// Some code
Dog[] dgs = new Dog[15];
dgs[0] = new Dog(10);
dgs[1] = new Dog(20);
```

**Static vs. Instance methods.** The distinction between static and instance methods is incredibly important. <mark style="color:red;">Instance methods are actions that can only be taken by an instance of the class</mark> (i.e. a specific object), <mark style="color:red;">whereas static methods are taken by the class itself</mark>. An instance method is invoked using a reference to a specific instance, e.g. `d.bark()`, whereas static methods should be invoked using the class name, e.g. `Math.sqrt()`. Know when to use each.

Instance method是类的对象（Instance or Object）调用的，Static method是Class调用的，也就是说不需要将Class实例话就可以直接调用的方法，特别是定义的函数方法类很有用，因为不可能调用函数之前先要定义一个对象。

**Static variables.** Variables can also be static. <mark style="color:red;">Static variables should be accessed using the class name</mark>, e.g. `Dog.binomen` as opposed to `d.binomen`. <mark style="color:red;">Technically Java allows you to access using a specific instance, but we strongly encourage you not to do this to avoid confusion.</mark>

**void methods.** A method which does not return anything should be given a void return type.

**The `this` keyword.** <mark style="color:red;">Inside a method, we can use the</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">`this`</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">keyword to refer to the current instance.</mark> This is equivalent to `self` in Python.

**public static void main(String\[] args).** We now know what each of these things means:

* <mark style="color:red;">public: So far, all of our methods start with this keyword.</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">static: It is a static method, not associated with any particular instance.</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">void: It has no return type.</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">main: This is the name of the method.</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">String\[] args: This is a parameter that is passed to the main method.</mark>

**Command Line Arguments.** Arguments can be provided by the operating system to your program as “command line arguments,” and can be accessed using the `args` parameter in `main`. For example if we call our program from the command line like this `java ArgsDemo these are command line arguments`, then the `main` method of `ArgsDemo` will have an array containing the Strings “these”, “are”, “command”, “line”, and “arguments”.

**Using Libraries.** There’s no need in the year 2017 to build everything yourself from scratch. In our course, you are allowed to and highly encouraged to use Java’s built-in libraries, as well as libraries that we provide, e.g. the Princeton standard library. You should not use libraries other than those provided or built into Java because it may render some of the assignments moot, and also our autograder won’t have access to these libraries and your code won’t work.

**Getting Help from the Internet.** You’re welcome to seek help online. However, you should always cite your sources, and you should not seek help on specific homework problems or projects. For example, googling “how convert String Java” or “how read file Java” are fine, but you should not be searching “project 2 61b java berkeley”.

### Exercises <a href="#exercises" id="exercises"></a>

#### Factual <a href="#factual" id="factual"></a>

1.  Complete the exercises from the [online textbook](https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/chap1/chap12.html).

    As noted in the lecture 1 study guide, we strongly encourage you to complete the optional HW0, which covers a bunch of basic Java syntax.
2.  In the below code what would the blank variable name have to be in order for the code to compile

    ```java
     public class Human{
       int __________;
       public Human(int ________){
         eyes = ___________;
       }
      }
    ```
3. Complete the check-in exercises, linked [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePaUIjbiJfh1UPrs8FgpmWsjBV\_PVYgSFORnpTbwg3gVVkdA/viewform?usp=sf\_link)

#### Conceptual <a href="#conceptual" id="conceptual"></a>

Below is the Dog class.

```java
    public class Dog{
      public void bark(){
        System.out.println("Moo");
      }
      public static void runFast(){
        System.out.println("Ruff Run");
      }
    }
```

1.  Which of the following lines, if any, would cause an error.

    ```java
     Dog poppa = new Dog();
     poppa.bark();
     Dog.bark();
     poppa.runFast();
     Dog.runFast();
    ```
2. What modifications could we make to ensure our code compiles and executes correctly?

#### Procedural <a href="#procedural" id="procedural"></a>

Let’s imagine I wanted to be able to create a special kind of `Dog` which displayed a unique String defined by the user when its `bark()` method is invoked. What additions would you have to make to your `Dog` class? What changes would you have to make? Try implementing it!

#### Metacognitive <a href="#metacognitive" id="metacognitive"></a>

What is the purpose of static variables? When designing code, what are cases in which the use of static variables leads to much cleaner code?
