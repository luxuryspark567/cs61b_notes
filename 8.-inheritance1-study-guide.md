### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

**Method Overloading** In Java, methods in a class can have the same name, but different parameters. For example, a `Math` class can have an `add(int a, int b)` method and an `add(float a, float b)` method as well. The Java compiler is smart enough to choose the correct method depending on the parameters that you pass in. <mark style="color:purple;">Methods with the same name but different parameters are said to be overloaded.</mark>

**Making Code General** Consider a `largestNumber` method that only takes an AList as a parameter. The drawback is that the logic for `largestNumber` is the same regardless of if we take an `AList` or `SLList`. We just operate on a different type of list. If we use our previous idea of method overriding, we result in a very long Java file with many similar methods. This code is hard to maintain; if we fix a bug in one method, we have to duplicate this fix manually to all the other methods.

The solution to the above problem is to <mark style="color:purple;">define a new reference type that represents both</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">`AList`</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">and</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">`SLList`</mark>. We will call it a `List`. Next, <mark style="color:red;">we specify</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**an “is-a” relationship**</mark><mark style="color:red;">: An</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">`AList`</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">is a</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">`List`</mark><mark style="color:red;">. We do the same for</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">`SLList`</mark>. Let’s formalize this into code.

**Interfaces** We will use the keyword `interface` instead of `class` to create our `List`. More explicitly, we write:

<pre class="language-java"><code class="lang-java"><strong>public interface List&#x3C;Item> { ... }
</strong></code></pre>

The key idea is that <mark style="color:purple;">interfaces specify what this</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">`List`</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">can do, not how to do it</mark>. Since all lists have a `get` method, we add the following method signature to the interface class:

Notice we did not define this method. We simply stated that this method should exist as long as we are working with a `List` interface.

Now, we want to specify that an `AList` is a `List`. We will change our class declaration of `AList` to:

```java
public AList<Item> implements List<Item> { ... }
```

We can do the same for `SLList`. Now, going back to our `largestNumber` method, <mark style="color:red;">instead of creating one method for each type of list, we can simply create one method that takes in a</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">`List`</mark>. As long as our actual object implements the `List` interface, then this method will work properly!

**Overriding** For each method in `AList` that we also defined in `List`, we will add an @Override right above the method signature. As an example:

```java
@Override
public Item get(int i) { ... }
```

This is not technically necessary, but is good style and thus we will require it. Also, it allows us to check against typos. If we mistype our method name, the compiler will prevent our compilation if we have the @Override tag.

**Interface Inheritance** Formally, we say that subclasses inherit from the superclass. Interfaces contain all <mark style="color:purple;">the method signatures</mark>, and <mark style="color:red;">each subclass</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**must**</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">implement every single signature</mark>; think of it as a contract. In addition, relationships can span multiple generations. For example, C can inherit from B, which can inherit from A.

**Default Methods** Interfaces can have default methods. We define this via:

```java
default public void method() { ... }
```

We can actually implement these methods inside the interface. Note that <mark style="color:red;">there are no instance variables to use, but we can freely use the methods that are defined in the interface, without worrying about the implementation.</mark> Default methods should work for any type of object that implements the interface! The subclasses do not have to re-implement the default method anywhere; they can simply call it for free. However, we can still override default methods, and re-define the method in our subclass.

<mark style="color:red;">要注意两点：1，除了default method外，其他的method都必须Override；2，interface不能被instantiated。</mark>

**Static vs. Dynamic Type** <mark style="color:purple;">Every variable in Java has a static type. This is the type specified when the variable is declared, and is checked at compile time. Every variable also has a dynamic type; this type is specified when the variable is instantiated, and is checked at runtime.</mark> As an example:

```java
Thing a;
a = new Fox();
```

Here, <mark style="color:green;">`Thing`</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">is the static type, and</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">`Fox`</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">is the dynamic type. This is fine because all foxes are things</mark>.

```java
public static void main(String[] args){
    List61B<String> someList = new SLList<String>();
    someList.addFirst("elk");
}
```

<mark style="color:blue;">上面的代码可以正常运行</mark>

### Exercises <a href="#exercises" id="exercises"></a>

#### Factual <a href="#factual" id="factual"></a>

1. Describe the relationship between an interface and a class that implements it in your own words. What are three examples from real life of this relationship? Discuss this with a peer!
2. How many classes can a specific class implement at most? How many classes can implement a specific class at most?
3. These check-in exercises, listed [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfnZdX5pN5Gg6RmF4XZ9ZLP2nJmQbbit3SLY7tw\_gsorjBuVg/viewform?usp=sf\_link)

#### Conceptual <a href="#conceptual" id="conceptual"></a>

1. Let’s imagine we create a Dog interface with implementing classes BigDog and SmallDog. What are some examples of default methods we could utilize from the Dog class and what are methods we would want to override?
2. Let’s imagine we create a Dog interface with implementing classes BigDog and SmallDog. We have a Dog constructor in our Dog class. Why do we still have to write a constructor in our BigDog and SmallDog classes?

#### Procedural <a href="#procedural" id="procedural"></a>

1. How would you implement the two constructors from Conceptual question 2 if you were attempting to maximize code reuse? Try it out.

#### Metacognitive <a href="#metacognitive" id="metacognitive"></a>

1. How does the idea of inheritance connect to what we already know? How can we use these ideas to optimize our IntList code?
2. What are the shortcomings you can identify with the rules of inheritance we have learned? Do you think they are intentional (a feature which is annoying to the writer but leads to code that is “better” in some way) or unintentional (a side effect of a behavior we want)? An example is that we have to ensure we use consistent, correct spelling of our method names or we will not get the behavior we want! This is intentional because it lets our users feel confident that they will know how to interact with our objects! Can you convince your peer to agree with you?
