### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

**Lists vs. Arrays** Our `DLList` has a drawback. Getting the i’th item is slow; we have to scan through each item in the list, starting from the beginning or the end, until we reach the i’th item. For an array named `A`, however, we can quickly access the i’th item using bracket notation, `A[i]`. Thus, our goal is to implement a list with an array.

**AList** The `AList` will have the same API as our `DLList`, meaning it will have the same methods as `DLList` (`addLast()`, `getLast()`, `removeLast()`, and `get(int i)`). The `AList` will also have a `size` variable that tracks its size.

**AList Invariants** There are a few invariants for our `AList`.

* `addLast`: The next item we want to add, will go into position `size`.
* `getLast`: The item we want to return is in position `size - 1`.
* `size`: The number of items in the list should be `size`.

**Implementing AList** Each `AList` has an `int[]` called `items`.

* For `addLast`, we place our item in `items[size]`.
* For `getLast`, we simply return `items[size - 1]`.
* For `removeLast`, we simply decrement `size` (we don’t need to change `items`). Thus, if `addLast` is called next, it simply overwrites the old value, because size was decremented. **However, it is good practice to null out objects when they are removed, as this will save memory.** Notice how closely these methods were related to the invariants.

**Abstraction** One key idea of this course is that the implementation details can be hidden away from the users. For example, a user may want to use a list, but we, as implementers, can give them any implementation of a list, as long as it meets their specifications. A user should have no knowledge of the inner workings of our list.

**Array Resizing** When the array gets too full, we can resize the array. However, we have learned that array size cannot change. The solution is, instead, to create a new array of a larger size, then copy our old array values to the new array. Now, we have all of our old values, but we have more space to add items.

**Resizing Speed** In the lecture video, we started off resizing the array by one more each time we hit our array size limit. This turns out to be extremely slow, because copying the array over to the new array means we have to perform the copy operation for each item. The worst part is, since we only resized by one extra box, if we choose to add another item, we have to do this again each time we add to the array.

**Improving Resize Performance** Instead of adding by an extra box, we can instead create a new array with `size * FACTOR` items, where `FACTOR` could be any number, like 2 for example. We will discuss why this is fast later in the course.

**Downsizing Array Size** What happens if we have a 1 million length array, but we remove 990,000 elements of the array? Well, similarly, we can downsize our array by creating an array of half the size, if we reach 250,000 elements, for example. Again, we will discuss this more rigorously later in the course.

**Aside: Breaking Code Up** Sometimes, we write large methods that do multiple things. A better way is to break our large methods up into many smaller methods. One advantage of this is that we can test our code in parts.

**Generic AList** Last time, we discussed how to make a generic `DLList`. We can do something similar for `AList`. But we find that we error out on array creation. <mark style="color:red;">Our problem is that generic arrays are not allowed in Java</mark>. Instead, we will change the line (Type is Item):

```java
items = new Item[100]; //this is not allowed
```

to:

```java
items = (Item[]) new Object[100];
```

This is called a cast, and we will learn about it in the future.

### Exercises <a href="#exercises" id="exercises"></a>

#### Factual <a href="#factual" id="factual"></a>

1. Complete the exercises from the online textbook [here](https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/chap2/chap25.html).
2. Complete the check-in exercises, linked [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXXTjrtiwcqRqajEYJSfEjRhy772UO3Df28T7bUa2GQ0wLdQ/viewform?usp=sf\_link)

#### Conceptual <a href="#conceptual" id="conceptual"></a>

1. We did not touch upon the method `addFirst` for an `AList`. Think of some of the problems you would experience in writing an `addFirst` method, and think of some potential solutions.
2. Once you think of three potential solutions, evaluate their strengths and pick an approach to attempt that you feel is the strongest. Why did you pick that approach? Would you be able to convince your peer that the implementation you picked was the optimal choice?

#### Procedural <a href="#procedural" id="procedural"></a>

Implement the approach you selected in the conceptual questions.

#### Metacognitive <a href="#metacognitive" id="metacognitive"></a>
