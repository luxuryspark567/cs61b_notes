### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

**Naked Data Structures** `IntLists` are hard to use. In order to use an `IntList` correctly, the programmer must understand and utilize recursion even for simple list related tasks.

**Adding Clothes** First, we will turn the `IntList` class into an `IntNode` class. Then, we will delete any methods in the `IntNode` class. Next, we will create a new class called `SLList`, which contains the instance variable `first`, and this variable should be of type `IntNode`. In essence, we have “wrapped” our `IntNode` with an `SLList`.

**Using SLList** As a user, to create a list, I call the constructor for `SLList`, and pass in the number I wish to fill my list with. The `SLList` constructor will then call the `IntList` constructor with that number, and set `first` to point to the `IntList` it just created.

**Improvement** Notice that when creating a list with one value, we wrote `SLList list = new SLList(1)`. We did not have to worry about passing in a null value like we did with our `IntList`. Essentially, the SLList class acts as a middleman between the list user and the naked `IntList`.

**Public vs. Private** We want users to modify our list via `SLList` methods only, and not by directly modifying `first`. <mark style="color:red;">We can prevent other users from doing so by setting our variable access to</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">`private`</mark>. Writing `private IntNode first;` prevents code in other classes from accessing and modifying `first` (while the code inside the class can still do so).

**Nested Classes** We can also move classes into classes to make nested classes! <mark style="color:red;">You can also declare the nested classes to be private as well; this way, other classes can never use this nested class.</mark>

```java
package lec5_lists2.solution;

/** An SLList is a list of integers, which hides the terrible truth
   * of the nakedness within. */
public class SLList {	
	private static class IntNode {
		public int item;
		public IntNode next;

		public IntNode(int i, IntNode n) {
			item = i;
			next = n;
			// System.out.println(size);
		}
	} 

	/* The first item (if it exists) is at sentinel.next. */
	private IntNode sentinel;
	private int size;

	private static void lectureQuestion() {
		SLList L = new SLList();
		IntNode n = new IntNode(5, null);
	}

	/** Creates an empty SLList. */
	public SLList() {
		sentinel = new IntNode(63, null);
		size = 0;
	}

	public SLList(int x) {
		sentinel = new IntNode(63, null);
		sentinel.next = new IntNode(x, null);
		size = 1;
	}

 	/** Adds x to the front of the list. */
 	public void addFirst(int x) {
 		sentinel.next = new IntNode(x, sentinel.next);
 		size = size + 1;
 	}

 	/** Returns the first item in the list. */
 	public int getFirst() {
 		return sentinel.next.item;
 	}

 	/** Adds x to the end of the list. */
 	public void addLast(int x) {
 		size = size + 1; 		

 		IntNode p = sentinel;

 		/* Advance p to the end of the list. */
 		while (p.next != null) {
 			p = p.next;
 		}

 		p.next = new IntNode(x, null);
 	}
 	
 	/** Returns the size of the list. */
 	public int size() {
 		return size;
 	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
 		/* Creates a list of one integer, namely 10 */
 		SLList L = new SLList();
 		L.addLast(20);
		L.addFirst(100);
 		System.out.println(L.size());
		System.out.println(L.getFirst());
		System.out.println(L.sentinel.next.next.item);
 	}
}
```

**Static Nested Classes** If the `IntNode` class never uses any variable or method of the `SLList` class, we can turn this class static by adding the “static” keyword.&#x20;

Static是指成员为所有instance共有，非static为每个instance独有。<mark style="color:orange;">Static成员（method，或者是IntNode这样的Class成员）不能调用instance 成员。因为Static是所有instance共有的，如果调用了instance成员，那么instance是指的哪个instance呢？无法明确，因此无法使用。</mark>

1，construct不需要返回值，也不需要声明Void；

2，没有声明为static的function是class的每个对象独有的，所以每个对象都应该可以重写，或者是为了子类可以重写？

_<mark style="color:purple;">**Static**</mark> variables and functions belong to the whole class. Example: Every 61B Student shares the same professor, and if the professor were to change it would change for everyone._

_<mark style="color:purple;">**Instance**</mark> variables and functions belong to each individual instance. Example: Each 61B Student has their own ID number, and changing a student’s ID number doesn’t change anything for any other student._

**Recursive Helper Methods** If we want to write a recursive method in `SLList`, how would we go about doing that? After all, the `SLList` is not a naturally recursive data structure like the `IntNode`. A common idea is to write an outer method that users can call. <mark style="color:blue;">This method calls a private helper method that takes</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">`IntNode`</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">as a parameter.</mark> This helper method will then perform the recursion, and return the answer back to the outer method.

**Caching** Previously, we calculated the size of our `IntList` recursively by returning 1 + the size of the rest of our list. This becomes really slow if our list becomes really big, and we repeatedly call our size method. Now that we have an `SLList`, lets simply cache the size of our list as an instance variable! Note that we could not do this before without `IntList`.

**Empty Lists** With an`SLList`, we can now represent an empty list. We simply set `first` to `null` and `size` to `0`. However, we have introduced some bugs; namely, because `first` is now `null`, any method that tries to access a property of `first` (like `first.item`) will return a <mark style="color:orange;">`NullPointerException`</mark>. Of course, we can fix this bug by writing code that handles this special case. But there may be many special cases. Is there a better solution?

<mark style="color:orange;">**Sentinel Nodes**</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">Lets make all</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`SLList`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">objects, even empty lists, the same</mark>. To do this, lets give each SLList a sentinel node, a node that is always there. Actual elements go after the sentinel node, and all of our methods should respect the idea that sentinel is always the first element in our list.

**Invariants** <mark style="color:blue;">An invariant is a fact about a data structure that is guaranteed to be true (assuming there are no bugs in your code)</mark>. This gives us a convenient checklist every time we add a feature to our data structure. Users are also guaranteed certain properties that they trust will be maintained. For example, an `SLList` with a sentinel node has at least the following invariants:

* The sentinel reference always points to a sentinel node.
* The front item (if it exists), is always at sentinel.next.item.
* The size variable is always the total number of items that have been added.

### Exercises <a href="#exercises" id="exercises"></a>

#### Factual <a href="#factual" id="factual"></a>

1. Complete the exercises from the [online textbook](https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/chap2/chap22.html).
2. Complete the check-in exercises, linked [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewpmte-i1ekzjcYiZfx-FjbjRxvX-nt52zGEEBwUMuJKFLGQ/viewform?usp=sf\_link)

#### Conceptual <a href="#conceptual" id="conceptual"></a>

1. In your own words, explain what the sentinel node is, and why it’s important. What are benefits of the sentinel in terms of how you write your code?
2. If the sentinel node was a node with a value of null, would it change anything or would the Intlist be able to function? How is this different from accidentally not having a sentinel node at all, given your implementation is expecting a sentinel?
3. What is the downside of not having a size variable and rather just calculate the size each time?

#### Procedural <a href="#procedural" id="procedural"></a>

1. Starting from the copy of [SLList.java provided to you in the lecture code repository](https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/lectureCode-fa22/blob/main/lec5\_lists2/SLList.java), implement the method `deleteFirst`, which deletes the first element in your SLList. Don’t forget to maintain the three invariants discussed above.
2. Starting from the copy of SLList.java provided to you in the lecture code repository, implement a second constructor that takes in an array of integers, and creates an SLList with those integers. Again, remember to maintain your invariants.

#### Metacognitive <a href="#metacognitive" id="metacognitive"></a>

1. We want to add a method to IntList so that if 2 numbers in a row are the same, we add them together and make one large node. For example: 1 → 1 → 2 → 3 becomes 2 → 2 → 3 which becomes 4 → 3

```java
public class IntList {
    public int first;
    public IntList rest;
    public IntList(int f, IntList r){
        ...
    }
    public void addAdjacent() {
        //TODO: your code here
    }
}
```

1. Modify the [provided SLList class](https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/lectureCode-fa22/blob/main/lec5\_lists2/SLList.java) to create a method `public IntList addConstant(int c)` which adds the constant value `c` to each element in the list. For example, if you had list 1 -> 2 -> 3 and you called `addConstant(1)` on it, the result would be 2 -> 3 -> 4.
