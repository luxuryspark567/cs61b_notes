### Overview [#](broken-reference) <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

**Runtime Analysis.** Understanding the runtime of code involves deep thought. It amounts to asking: “How long does it take to do stuff?”, where stuff can be any conceivable computational process whatsoever. It simply cannot be done mechanically, at least for non-trivial problems. As an example, a pair of nested for loops does NOT mean $\Theta(N^2)$ runtime as we saw in lecture.

**Cost Model.** As an anchor for your thinking, recall the idea of a “cost model” from last lecture. Pick an operation and count them. You want the one whose count has the highest order of growth as a function of the input size.

**Important Sums.** This is not a math class so we’ll be a bit sloppy, but the two key sums that you should know are that:

* $1 + 2 + 3 + … + N \in \Theta(N^2)$
* $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + … + N \in \Theta(N)$

**Practice.** The only way to learn this is through plenty of practice. Make sure to work through the problems in lecture and below when you have some time.

### Recommended Problems [#](broken-reference) <a href="#recommended-problems" id="recommended-problems"></a>

#### C level [#](broken-reference) <a href="#c-level" id="c-level"></a>

1. Prove that $O(N + \frac{N}{2} + \frac{N}{4} +…. 2 + 1)= O(N)$ (hand wavy proof is okay as long as you gain the intuition)
2.  What would the runtime of `modified_fib` be. Assume that values is an array of size n. If a value in an int array is not initialized to a number, it is automatically set to 0.

    ```java
     public void modified_fib(int n, int[] values){
       if(n <= 1){
         values[n] = n;
         return n;
       }
       else{
         int val = values[n];
         if(val == 0){
           val = modified_fib(n-1, values) + modified_fib(n-2, values);
           values[n] = val;
         }
         return val;
       }
     }  
    ```
3. Prove to yourself that $\Theta(log\_2(n)) = \Theta(log\_3(n)) $

#### B level [#](broken-reference) <a href="#b-level" id="b-level"></a>

1. Find the runtime of running print\_fib with for arbitrary large n.

Theta(n)

```java
 public void print_fib(int n){
   for(int i = 0; i < n; i++i){
       System.out.println(fib(i));
   }
 }

 public int fib(int n){
   if(n <= 0){
     return 0;
   }
   elif(n == 1){
     return 1;
   }
   else{
     return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
   }
 }
```

2. Do problem 5 again, but change the body of the for loop in `print_fib` to be

Theta(n)

```java
 System.out.println(fib(n));
```

3. Find the runtime of this function

Theta(N^3)

```java
 public void melo(int N){
   for(int i = 0; i < N*N; i++){
     System.out.println("Gelo is fruit pudding");
   }
   for(int i = 0; i < N*N*N; i++){
     System.out.println("Zo Two the Warriors");
   }
 }
```

4. Find the runtime of this function

Theta(N) = 2N - 1

```java
 public void grigobreath(int N){
     if(N==0){
       return;
     }
     for(int i  = 0; i < N; i++){
       System.out.println("Gul-great")
     }
     grigobreath(N * 1/2);
     grigobreath(N * 1/4);
     grigobreath(N * 1/4);
 }
```
