# 22. Graphs Traversals and Implementation Guide

### Overview&#x20;

**Graph Traversals Overview.** Just as we had both depth-first (preorder, inorder, and postorder) traversals and a breadth-first (level order) traversal for trees, we can generalize these concepts to graphs. Specifically, given a source vertex, we can “visit” vertices in:

* **DFS Preorder**: order in which DFS is called on each vertex.
* **DFS Postorder**: order in which we return from DFS calls.
* **BFS**: order of distance from the source. The lecture originally called this “level order” before we banish that term since nobody uses it in the real world for general graphs.

We use the term <mark style="color:red;">“depth first”, because we will explore “deeply” first</mark> (a la [https://xkcd.com/761/](https://fa22.datastructur.es/materials/lectures/lec24/this%20xkcd)]), and use the term <mark style="color:red;">“breadth first” because we go wide before we go deep</mark>.

If we use BFS on a vertex of a graph that happens to be the root of a tree, we get exactly the same thing as level order traversal.

<mark style="color:red;">**Breadth First Search**</mark>**.** Unlike DFS, BFS lends itself more naturally to an iterative solution than a recursive one. <mark style="color:red;">When we perform BFS, we visit a source vertex s, then visit every vertex that is one link away from s, then visite very vertex that is two links away from s, and so forth.</mark>

To achieve this, we use a simple idea: Create a so-called “fringe” of vertices that we think of as the next vertices to be explored. <mark style="color:red;">In the case of BFS, this fringe</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**is a Queue**</mark>, since we want to visit vertices in the order that we observe them. The pseudocode is as follows:

* 每次enqueue的时候mark；
* 每次dequeue的时候visit；
* 直到fringe queue为空，结束while循环；
* <mark style="color:red;">注意，BFS不是recursive，而是用了一个queue。</mark>

```java
bfs(s):
    fringe.enqueue(s)
    mark(s)
    while fringe is not empty:
        dequeue(s)
        visit(s)
        for each unmarked neighbor w of s:
            mark(w)
            enqueue(w)
```

In class, we discussed how we could use BFS to solve <mark style="color:red;">**the shortest paths problem**</mark>: <mark style="color:red;">Given a source vertex, find the shortest path from that source to every other vertex.</mark> When solving shortest paths, we add additional logic to our BFS traversal, where we also <mark style="color:red;">set the edgeTo</mark> for every vertex at the same time that it is marked and enqueued.

**Graph API.** In lecture, we used the Graph API from the Princeton algorithms book. <mark style="color:red;">Choice of API determines how clients need to think to write codes, since certain API’s can make certain tasks easier or harder. This can also affect runtime and memory.</mark>

The Graph API from our optional textbook.

```java
public class Graph {
  private final int V;           // number of vertices
  private int E;                 // number of edges
  private Bag<Integer>[] adj;    // adjacency lists
  public Graph(int V);           // constructor, create empty graph with v vertices
  public void addEdge(int v, int w);//add an edge v-w
  Iterable<Integer> adj(int v);  //get an iterator for vertices adjacent to v
  int V();                       //get number of vertices
  int E();                       //get number of edges
...
```

Example client:

```java
/** degree of vertex v in graph G */
public static int degree(Graph G, int v) {
	int degree = 0;
	for (int w : G.adj(v)) {
    	    degree += 1;
    	}
	return degree; }
```

Some features:

* Number of vertices must be specified in advance.
* Does not support weights (labels) on nodes or edges.
* Has no method for getting the number of edges for a vertex (i.e. its degree).

**Graph Implementations.** Several graph API implementations we explored included <mark style="color:red;">an adjacency matrix, list of edges, and adjacency lists</mark>. With an **adjacency matrix**, <mark style="color:red;">we essentially have a 2D array with a boolean indicating whether two vertices are adjacent</mark>. A **list of edges** is simply that – <mark style="color:red;">a collection of all edges</mark>, such as HashSet. The most common approach, **adjacency lists**, maintains <mark style="color:red;">an array of lists indexed by vertex number which stores the vertex numbers of all vertices adjacent to the given vertex</mark>.

To Implement our graph algorithms like BreadthFirstPaths and DepthFirstPaths, we need:

<mark style="color:red;">**1, An API**</mark> (Application Programming Interface) for graphs.

* For our purposes today, these are our Graph methods, including their signatures and behaviors.
* Defines how Graph client programmers must think.
* <mark style="color:red;">An underlying data structure</mark> to represent our graphs.

<mark style="color:red;">2, An underlying data structure</mark> to represent our graphs.

Common convention: Number nodes irrespective of “label”, and use number throughout the graph implementation. To lookup a vertex by label, you’d need to use a <mark style="color:red;">Map\<Label, Integer></mark>.

For adjacency lists implementation:

All cases: Θ(V + E)

* <mark style="color:red;">**Create V iterators.**</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">**Print E times.**</mark>

E的变化决定了复杂度，在sparse的情况下，E很小，可以认为复杂度是Theta(V)；在very dense的情况下，E差不多是V\*V，复杂度也就是Theta(V\*V)。

#### A level&#x20;

1. Develop an algorithm that determines whether or not a directed graph contains an Eulerian tour, i.e. a tour that visits every vertex exactly once.
2.  Adapted from Algorithms textbook 4.2.27: Show that the number of different V-vertex directed graphs is 2^(V^2) (reminder, in our course, we do not allow “parallel edges”, i.e. you cannot have two or more edges from a vertex v to another vertex w).

    Then compute an upper bound on the percentage of 20-vertex digraphs that could ever be examined by any computer, under the assumptions that every electron in the universe examines a digraph every nanosecond, that the universe has fewer than 10^80 electrons, and that the age of the universe will be less than 10^20 years.

#### Just for fun&#x20;

1. Adapted from Algorithms textbook 4.2.40: Run experiments to determine empirically the probability that DepthFirstDirectedPaths finds a path between two randomly chosen vertices and to calculate the average length of the paths found, for various random digraph models.
